# TechRocket
The 6th version of the [TechAirlines](http://www.techairlines.com/) website, named TechRocket. Developed using [Insider](http://www.theme-junkie.com/themes/insider/) by [Theme Junkie](http://www.theme-junkie.com/) as a base framework. All provided theme options were removed.

## Review Box
Theme includes a custom plugin for the review-at-a-glance box displayed next to product reviews. This plugin adds a box to WordPress's post editing screen to edit the sidebar box. It is currently integrated with the theme, but I may change it into a standalone plugin in the future.

Plugin files are `functions/techreview.php`, `functions/techreview-meta.php`, and `functions/techreview-box.php`.
